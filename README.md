****************************************************
the last couple of weeks I read about pizza theory which states that: "the equality of two areas
that arise when one partitions a disk in a certain way." and now I'm going to show it in the computer world.

the method is user choose an arbitrary point in our pizza and the code divide pizza to n pieces that n determine by user
and let n be a multiple of 4 and greater than or equal to 8.

-report.pdf and demo.mp4 are just for showing the results<br>
-c.png is our taken pizza image<br>
-show.py and specially pizza.py are the main codes<br>
